Data is the new oil. When we talk about data, we should not forget, that, as oil, it should be first harvested, then refined, and only then it can be used, to fuel the engines of the statistical and machine learning systems to generate insights, understand what our customers want, and make correct decisions faster than others. We at Zalando – one of the biggest online fashion retailers in Europe – are working hard on making data be that oil for us. I will cover the problems of harvesting and understanding data and will talk on where we at Zalando succeed and where we still need to do more progress on making data – the fuel of our future.</div><i></i></div></li><li><div class="row"><div class="time"><p>10:30 - 10:50</p></div><div class="author"><p>Michael Crawford</p></div><div class="title has_descr"><p>How not to spend $1,000,000 in 12 months for no return</p><i></i></div></div><div class="description"><div>Setting up a data science function in a business is hard.

A growing number of citizens are pursuing facts themselves. Bellingcat, an international investigative collective, uses online open source information in combination with digital tools to uncover the facts themselves. How do they work, and which tools and methods do they use? In this short talk, the audience will be shown the power of open source investigation.</div><i></i></div></li><li><div class="row"><div class="time"><p>13:00 - 13:20</p></div><div class="author"><p>Jason Addie</p></div><div class="title has_descr"><p>Open data: for eveyone by everyone</p><i></i></div></div><div class="description"><div>NGOs around the world are demanding that governments make their data open and available to the public.

It didn't. We left a space open for narratives who only use data to serve the goal they want to prove rather then to seek the truth. What should data people do? How to combine stories with data?

How can we transform data into stories that give life and longevity to the ideas we are trying to communicate? How can we turn hard science into engaging, emotional experiences for our audiences? Why is this important?

The result was Oddityviz, a collection of ten engraved records visualizing data from the song. Each 12-inch disc deconstructs the track in a different way: melodies, harmonies, lyrics, structure and story are transformed into new visual systems. The records are accompanied by a series of matching posters and a moving image piece that visualizes the music in real time. Oddityviz was exhibited at W+K London in January 2017. Miriam will talk about how they created the project and what they learned along the way.</div><i></i></div></li><li><div class="row highlight"><div class="time"><p>16:20 - 17:00</p></div><div class="break"><p>Coffee Break</p></div></div></li><li><div class="row"><div class="time"><p>17:00 - 17:20</p></div><div class="author"><p>Andriy Gazin</p></div><div class="title has_descr"><p>Developing data visualization: from A to Z</p><i></i></div></div><div class="description"><div>The goal of this talk is to present data visualization process from a starting point (data) to the end (visualization).

The  project aims to identify outbreaks or 'unusual time events' associated with time series data pertaining to terrorist events. A detailed investigation of the GTD (Global terrorism database) was undertaken. The research aimed to detect early onset of a rise or out breaks in terrorism. Such information would be useful for governments, businesses (such as re-insurers) and risk management professionals. A number of modelling and data visualization techniques were used to gain an understanding of temporal, spatio-temporal and region-temporal terrorist behavior. Key methodologies were identified for analysis of interesting ‘time series count events’ of terrorist related metrics (such as count of incidents or deaths due to terrorism). Interesting time series events would encompass mean shifts or gradual shifts, outbreaks and anomalies. Using a mix of algorithmic techniques from syndromic surveillance methods to time series outlier detection methods outbreaks of terrorism, mean shifts or gradual shifts in terrorist behaviors are found and correlated with real world events.</div><i></i></div><div class="room"><p>Room 4</p></div><div class="title has_descr" data-room="5"><p>Building REST API for serving Data with Zalando Connexion (Amil Osmanli, Ireland)</p><i></i></div><div class="description" data-room="5"><div>Many of you have created a useful data model like recommendation system, natural language processing, sentiment analysis model, or perhaps image color recognition and wanted to expose outcome to the world in easy and fast manner. This workshop aims to give introduction to how to build a RESTful application and how you can rapidly serve any data with a minimal effort. In this interactive workshop we will cover how to build RESTful API using Zalando Connexion. Connexion is a lightweight framework that uses Swagger specifications and Python Flask to define and build APIs very rapidly.<br />By the end of this workshop you will be able to build RESTful API for any data, that can serve high load, and scale on demand. If you are familiar with Python, this workshop will show you how to use basic coding skills to develop production ready project. Bring your laptop and code alongside, or if you got any questions regarding REST, Swagger specs and Python Connexion, you can join the workshop too. Before the session, I highly recommend to visit the workshop web-page and follow the setup instructions.  This will ensure that you have everything installed to code during this workshop. If you have any problems with setting up create GitHub issue and I will answer them.</div><i></i></div><div class="room"><p>Room 5</p></div><div class="title l  has_descr" data-room="6"><p>Identifying a foreign political person (Andrew Jvirblis, Russia)</p><i></i></div><div class="description" data-room="6"><div>The speaker will reveal how the information about a Russian PEPs can be revealed using different sources, including the Declarator.org project, a unified database of asset and income declarations, as well as other methods and sources. Identifying foreign politically exposed persons became a crucial issue for different actors fighting against corruption and illicit financial flows: financial institutions, journalists, NGO activists, law enforcement authorities. A high ranked employee that wish to spend his illicit money abroad should not become a private person just crossing the border, but how their identity can be revealed? The workshop participants will discuss the possible sources of information about politically exposed persons in the jurisdictions of their origin, the requirements for such information, their weaknesses and the legal background behind.</div><i></i></div></div><div class="descriptions"><div></div></div></li><li><div class="row highlight"><div class="time f"><p>17:00 - 17:30</p></div><div class="break l"><p>Break</p></div></div></li><li><div class="row"><div class="time f"><p>17:30 - 19:00</p></div><div class="room"><p>Library Room</p></div><div class="title" ><p>DataFest Mini-Hackathon challenge presentation & team formation</p></div><div class="room"><p>Room 1</p></div><div class="title has_descr" data-room="2"><p>Data-driven Objective and Key Results (OKR) for High-Performing Teams (Oana Calugar, Germany)</p><i></i></div><div class="description" data-room="2"><div>This interactive workshop will demonstrate the power of the framework Objective and Key Results, and how it can be used to align people, improve employee performance and engagement, in a transparent and data-driven manner.

In this workshop we first build a linear model using OLS/MLE optimisation to fit the parameters and progress to the equivalent Bayesian fit using prebuilt models provided by the R package 'rstanarm'. We use this approach to explain the core concepts of Bayesian data analysis including the concept of prior and posterior distributions and discuss how the output can give us a more robust understanding of our analysis.<br /><br />Part2: In this talk we introduce the concept of hierarchical models via Stan - an open source project that provides us with a probabilistic programming language and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to produce posterior distributions that we use to make inferences on our problems. In this workshop we discuss a binomial problem, an event that has two possible outcomes, success or failure, and are trying to learn as much as we can about the probability of a given outcome. We discuss the use and interpretation of hierarchical models to allow us to get the maximum use from our data.</div><i></i></div><div class="room"><p>Room 5</p></div><div class="title l " ><p>TransparenCEE meeting</p></div></div><div class="descriptions"><div></div></div></li><li><div class="row highlight"><div class="time f"><p>11:30 - 12:00</p></div><div class="break l"><p>Break</p></div></div></li><li><div class="row"><div class="time f"><p>12:00 - 13:30</p></div><div class="room"><p>Library Room</p></div><div class="title" ><p>Ministry of Data & DataFest Hackathon Mentorship sessions</p></div><div class="room"><p>Room 1</p></div><div class="title has_descr" data-room="2"><p>Digital Forensics: A Walk-Through of Bellingcat's Investigations (Christiaan Triebert, Bellingcat)</p><i></i></div><div class="description" data-room="2"><div>In 1,5-hours, Christiaan Triebert will provide participants with detailed walk-through of how open source investigations were conducted, showing tools, resources and methods used.
