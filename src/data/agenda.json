We at Zalando – one of the biggest online fashion retailers in Europe – are working hard on making data be that oil for us. I will cover the problems of harvesting and understanding data and will talk on where we at Zalando succeed and where we still need to do more progress on making data – the fuel of our future." },

Each 12-inch disc deconstructs the track in a different way: melodies, harmonies, lyrics, structure and story are transformed into new visual systems. The records are accompanied by a series of matching posters and a moving image piece that visualizes the music in real time. Oddityviz was exhibited at W+K London in January 2017.

A detailed investigation of the GTD (Global terrorism database) was undertaken. The research aimed to detect early onset of a rise or out breaks in terrorism. Such information would be useful for governments, businesses (such as re-insurers) and risk management professionals. A number of modelling and data visualization techniques were used to gain an understanding of temporal, spatio-temporal and region-temporal terrorist behavior. Key methodologies were identified for analysis of interesting ‘time series count events’ of terrorist related metrics (such as count of incidents or deaths due to terrorism). Interesting time series events would encompass mean shifts or gradual shifts, outbreaks and anomalies. Using a mix of algorithmic techniques from syndromic surveillance methods to time series outlier detection methods outbreaks of terrorism, mean shifts or gradual shifts in terrorist behaviors are found and correlated with real world events." },

In this workshop we first build a linear model using OLS/MLE optimisation to fit the parameters and progress to the equivalent Bayesian fit using prebuilt models provided by the R package 'rstanarm'. We use this approach to explain the core concepts of Bayesian data analysis including the concept of prior and posterior distributions and discuss how the output can give us a more robust understanding of our analysis.<br /><br />Part2: In this talk we introduce the concept of hierarchical models via Stan - an open source project that provides us with a probabilistic programming language and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to produce posterior distributions that we use to make inferences on our problems. In this workshop we discuss a binomial problem, an event that has two possible outcomes, success or failure, and are trying to learn as much as we can about the probability of a given outcome. We discuss the use and interpretation of hierarchical models to allow us to get the maximum use from our data." },

The first part of the talk will cover the theory behind A/B/n testing, its pros and cons. The second part will cover basics of Bayesian inference, which will be used in the third part of the talk. Last part will cover the theory behind Multi-armed bandits and its pros and cons. You will also be provided with a jupyter notebook, which you can use to follow the speaker and to run same experiments as he does." },

Including data ingestion, data cleaning, validation, aggregation, feature engineering etc. Those steps are usually refered as Data Engineering. With the rise of the volumes of the data we collect every day, complexity of the data management increases dramatically. In this workshop we are going to cover Data Engineering and some of the tools used there, especially distributed computation engine Apache Spark." },

Graph as a model representation can be crucial not only in social studies, but also advertisement, fraud investigation and even terrorism prevention. Graph theory is a very developed area of computer science and lots of excellent algorithms for achieving various tasks were created during the last century, but when your graph is too big for one machine to process, everything is different. During this workshop we are going to explore various aspects of distributed processing of a graph with more than a billion nodes. Starting from graph processing in general and leading to building a cross-device graph." },

Countless companies integrated GBMs in their production systems, including worlds largest search companies. But how do GBMs work and what can you do with them? In this workshop we will cover basics of GBMs: how GBM are more than just xgboost\lightgbm imports, but are actually a flexible general-purpose machine learning modeling framework. Then we will discuss how you properly cook these models: hows, dos and donts. And at last we will talk about modern libraries and implementations -- what are your options for casual boosting at your workplaces." },
