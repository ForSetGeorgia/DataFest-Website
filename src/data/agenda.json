Data is the new oil. When we talk about data, we should not forget, that, as oil, it should be first harvested, then refined, and only then it can be used, to fuel the engines of the statistical and machine learning systems to generate insights, understand what our customers want, and make correct decisions faster than others. We at Zalando – one of the biggest online fashion retailers in Europe – are working hard on making data be that oil for us. I will cover the problems of harvesting and understanding data and will talk on where we at Zalando succeed and where we still need to do more progress on making data – the fuel of our future." },

How can we transform data into stories that give life and longevity to the ideas we are trying to communicate? How can we turn hard science into engaging, emotional experiences for our audiences?

The result was Oddityviz, a collection of ten engraved records visualizing data from the song. Each 12-inch disc deconstructs the track in a different way: melodies, harmonies, lyrics, structure and story are transformed into new visual systems. The records are accompanied by a series of matching posters and a moving image piece that visualizes the music in real time. Oddityviz was exhibited at W+K London in January 2017. Miriam will talk about how they created the project and what they learned along the way."  },

Both the volume of information and the speed make it more important than ever for fact checking to infuse the sensibility of journalists and newsrooms the world over. Emma Lacey-Bordeaux looks at how this effort can become faster, more reflexive and done in service of telling good stories that people want to read, watch and share." },
